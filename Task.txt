Question 1 
Explore and explain the various methods in console function
Explain them
Ex. console.log()
console.warn().
etc...
Answer :-  
for eg-
console.log('Welcome to JavaScript');
-> Outputs a Welcome to JavaScript (message) to the console.

console.warn("Welcome to JavaScript");
-> Outputs a warning Welcome to JavaScript (message) to the console.

console.group(); 
->Creates a new inline group in the console. This indents following console
 messages by an additional level, until console.groupEnd() is called

Question 2 
Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.
Answer :-
Var -
The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable.

Example: var a =10;

Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.
The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global.
eg-
function nodeSimplified(){
  var a =10;
  console.log(a);  // output 10
  if(true){
   var a=20;
   console.log(a); // output 20
  }
  console.log(a);  // output 20
}
------------------------
Let
The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.

Example: let a =10;

The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.
It is similar to the variable we declare in other languages like Java, .NET, etc.
Consider the following code snippet.
eg-
function nodeSimplified(){
  let a =10;
  console.log(a);  // output 10
  if(true){
   let a=20;
   console.log(a); // output 20
  }
  console.log(a);  // output 10
}

---------------------------
Const
const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be 
reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let 
statements.

eg:
 const a =10;

function nodeSimplified(){
  const MY_VARIABLE =10;
  console.log(MY_VARIABLE);  //output 10 
}




------------------------------


Question 3 
Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript.
Answer :-
There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
boolean for true/false.
null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
object for more complex data structures.
symbol for unique identifiers.
